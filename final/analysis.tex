\section*{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

Unlike programming desktops, where one mainly 
  improves software by increasing either features or performance,
  mobile programmers develop for increase features, performance, and 
  battery life.
In fact, one of the main selling points for hetrogenous
  programming on mobile devices, is the increase in battery life.
Increasingly, hardware vendors, such as Apple or Samsung, sell new
  mobile hardware by advertising long battery life.

In this section we analyze hetrogenous programming on Android battery
  considering not only the performance, but also the power usage.
We conclude the section by discussing the programability of RenderScript
  and compare it against established programming models such as using
  native C, OpenMP, or OpenCL for kernel code.
