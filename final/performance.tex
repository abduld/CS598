\subsection{Performance}

We evaluate each benchmark and its implementations on the devices listed
  in Table~\ref{table:hardware}.
The performance measurments are collected by measuring the time
  spent within each section of the code (as discussed in~\ref{design}).
Each compute part of an implementation is run $5$ % TODO: what do we decide
  times and the minimum value is presented.
The performance times are also measured with the system connected to a
  power source, which avoids the device going to sleep.
