\section{Motivation and Background}
\todo[inline]{Assuming Introduction has a sentence or two about the
programmability problem.}


Heterogeneity of hardware resources has led to a diverse landscape
of different programming models, run-time systems, profiling and debugging tools
for application development. The differences are so deep that programmers are
often experts on only one class of device, e.g., an expert GPU programmer will
not have much DSP expertise and vice-versa. This is highly inefficient and
unproductive: we cannot expect applications to use a separate language for each
class of compute unit. If we want applications to use the full range of
available hardware to maximize performance or energy efficiency or both, the
programming environment has to provide common abstractions for available
hardware compute units.

OpenCL and RenderScript have been proposed to solve this problem. They are
designed to accelerate data parallel computation intensive part of application
code by allowing workload to be executed on multiple processing cores, GPUs,
DSPs or a combination of these. Here we give a brief overview of OpenCL and
RenderScript.
