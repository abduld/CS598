\section{Benchmarks}

In this section we give an overview of the benchmarks implemented along with 
	the dataset sizes we used when profiling the results.

\subsection{VectorAdd}

VectorAdd, unlike other benchmarks, has a very high memory to compute ratio.
We use two $8K$ input vectors and simple element by element addition.

\subsection{SGEMM}


SGEMM multiplies two matricies $A$ and $B$ together.
Matrix $A$ is of dimension $128 \times 96$ and $B$ is of dimension $96 \times 160$.
Matrix $A$ is stored in row major format while $B$ is stored in column major format --- we therfore do not need to transpose $B$ to make effective use of the cache.

The OpenMP code use the \fix{\#pragma omp parallel for shared(A, B, C) collapse(2)} pragma, which, based on the processor utilization, the Android GCC compiler is not able to understand as valid OpenMP code.
Therefore, the OpenMP code for SGEMM is equivalent to the serial C code.

\subsection{Stencil}

Stencil computes a 7 point stencil of an input volume. 
The volume has dimension $128 \times 128 \times 32$.

\subsection{Histogram}

Histogram computes the histogram of an input image.
The input image used is of size $996 \times 1040$ and compute a 
	histogram of size $256$.
Each bin in the histogram saturate at $255$.

Unlike the other parallel implementations, which use atomcs, both the
	threaded Java and OpenMP implementations use privitizations.
Private histogram copies are allocated and operated on, each thread 
	operates on its own private copy, and once the threads finish the
	master thread aggregates the results.
