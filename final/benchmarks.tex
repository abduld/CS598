\section{Benchmarks}

In this section we give an overview of the benchmarks implemented along with 
	the dataset sizes we used when profiling the results.
While these benchmarks represent scientific workloads we expect them to be 
	representative of certain Android applications --- especially since we 
	see that Android devices have already entered the laptop market.

\subsection{VectorAdd}

VectorAdd, unlike other benchmarks, has a very high memory to compute ratio.
We use two $8K$ input vectors and simple element by element addition.

\subsection{SGEMM}


SGEMM multiplies two matricies $A$ and $B$ together.
Matrix $A$ is of dimension $128 \times 96$ and $B$ is of dimension $96 \times 160$.
Matrix $A$ is stored in row major format while $B$ is stored in column major format --- we therfore do not need to transpose $B$ to make effective use of the cache.

The OpenMP code use the \fix{\#pragma omp parallel for shared(A, B, C) collapse(2)} pragma, which, based on the processor utilization, the Android GCC compiler is not able to understand as valid OpenMP code.
Therefore, the OpenMP code for SGEMM is equivalent to the serial C code.

\subsection{TPACF}

TPACF analyzes the angular distribution of astronomical objects.
It performs histogramming, collecting the restults in 3 histograms which are then
	cross correlated.
We use $100$ datasets, each containing $487$ corrdinates.

\subsection{MRIQ}

MRIQ computes a non-uniform 3D inverse fourier transform to create a 3D image.
The input image is of size $32 \times 32 \times 32$.

\subsection{Stencil}

Stencil computes a 7 point stencil of an input volume. 
The volume has dimension $128 \times 128 \times 32$.
Each kernel accesses the $6$ adjacent voxels, adding the results
	to its current voxel.
The result is then placed in the output buffer.

\subsection{Histogram}

Histogram computes the histogram of an input image.
The input image used is of size $996 \times 1040$ and compute a 
	histogram of size $256$.
Each bin in the histogram saturates at the value $255$.

Unlike the other parallel implementations, which use atomcs, both the
	threaded Java and OpenMP implementations use privitizations.
Private histogram copies are allocated, each thread 
	operates on its own private copy, and once the threads finish the
	master thread aggregates the results.
