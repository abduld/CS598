As the number of different hetrogenous devices increase, so does 
	the programming complexity.
Languages, such as OpenCL, which expose low level architectural 
	details either via the standard or extensions, result optimized
	for a certain class of hardware and therefore not performance
	portable.
RenderScript achieves performance portability by both hiding architectural
	details, performing offline optimization to an IR, and delaying 
	backend code generation until runtime.
To aid the runtime, the IR is decorated with hints to
	allow the runtime to make inteligent descisions to determine
	where code is to be executed.
We show, by rewriting the Parboil benchmark suite to run on Android,
	that RenderScript strikes a balance by
	hiding enough of the architectural details while still achieving
	both good peformance and energy utlization.
