\subsection{Performance Analysis}


\subsection{Load/Power Analysis}

Trepn is an external application that is run outside of our benchmark framework.
To pass messages to Trepn, we make use of Android's \fix{Intent} framework.
The \fix{Intent} framework allows one to pass message between applications.
Trpen records the time a message is recieved (which correspond to time blocks
in our code) and we developed scripts to correlate Trepn's data dump with both
the load and power usage.
