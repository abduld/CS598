\subsection{RenderScript Programmability}
Pros:

* Allocation is intuitive: Express data and computation simultaneously.

* Flexibility and performability of C?

* Portable; compare to OpenCL

* Debugging: much better with rsDebug. IDE supports showing compile errors.

* Active community: stackoverflow response time is good and the answers were useful.

Cons:

* No intrinsic synchronization within kernels

* Only support two coordinates.

* Overhead of data transfer. Even a kernel is executed in 

* Lack of documentation and standardization. Example: kernel invocation generation.
