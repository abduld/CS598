\todo[inline]{This needs more work....}

OpenCL and RenderScript have been proposed to solve this problem. They are
designed to accelerate data parallel computation intensive part of application
code by allowing workload to be executed on multiple processing cores, GPUs,
DSPs or a combination of these. Here we give a brief overview of OpenCL and
RenderScript.
