\todo[inline]{This needs more work....}

OpenCL and RenderScript have been proposed to solve this problem. They are
designed to accelerate data parallel computation intensive parts of application
code by allowing workloads to be executed on multiple processing cores, GPUs,
DSPs or a combination of these. Here we provide a brief overview of OpenCL and
RenderScript.
