\subsection{Input/Output}

Throughout the analysis, we have ignored IO times which is in fact the biggest
performance bottleneck in these benchmarks.
The main bottle neck is read speeds, since unlike desktops which have a hard
drive read speed of 80-100MB/s, mobile devices typically use use flash which
have a 7-25MB/s read speed.
In reality, however, computational data for mobile devices is not stored on
disk and is usually either streamed from the cloud or captured from onboard
sensors and therefore is available in RAM.
Therefore, to keep with the typical usage, and to not skew the plots, we
explicitly removed the IO performance times from our graphs.
