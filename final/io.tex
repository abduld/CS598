\subsection{Input/Output}

Throught the analysis, we have ignored IO times which is infact the biggest performance bottleneck in these benchmarks.
Unlike desktops which have a harddrive read speed of 80-100MB/s, Android devices use flash which have a 7-25MB/s read speed.
In reality, however, computational data for mobile devices are not stored on disk and are usually either streamed from the cloud or captured from onboard sensors and therefore are available in RAM.
To keep with the typical usage, and to not skew the plots, we therefore explicitly removed the IO performance times from our graphs.
