\section*{Progress Summary}

This section summarizes our progress to date~\footnote{Code is hosted on
\url{https://github.com/cmpham/RSBench}}. Table~\ref{table:parboil} shows the
porting status of each version of the benchmarks in the Parboil Benchmark Suite.
In this phase, we also worked on improving the framework, making it easy to collect
data and plot graphs. In parallel, we worked on getting OpenCL to work on our
devices (this was required as Android does not have official support for OpenCL
on Nexus tablets), and started porting the OpenCL version of the benchmarks. 
Further information on each task
is described in the subsequent sections.
