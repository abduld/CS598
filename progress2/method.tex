\section*{Methodology}
There is one major change in our strategy to evaluate RenderScript from our last
progress report. In our last report we mentioned that because of the ongoing competetion between
Google's RenderScript and Khronos Group's OpenCL, Google has decided not to ship
GPU-CPU RenderScript drivers in their Nexus phones/tablets firmware. They never
officialy supported the drivers for use by developers, but the Android 4.2 was
found to have unofficial OpenCL drivers. It was predicted that these drivers
would be removed from future versions and as expected Google removed these drivers from
Android 4.3 onwards. As a result we decided to focus on evaluating RenderScript
implementation against Single threaded and multi-threaded Java implementations. 

However, we have been able to manually install OpenCL drivers in Android 4.4.2
running on our Nexus 7 device and we would now be able to evaluate
RenderScript against OpenCL.
This requires one to hack the device and can be done for the Nexus 5 device, but
  we have not done so already.
