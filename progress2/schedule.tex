\section*{Schedule}

As before, we think we are not too far behind of our initial 
  projection while still adding new tasks to our initial proposal.
We had setup around 1-2 weeks to allow us to recover 
  from some set backs.
In the comming weeks we will be concentrating on finishing the 
  RenderScript implementations for all the benchmarks as well
  as resolving the OpenCL issues.
To allow us to stay on schedule, we may be dropping some benchamrks that
  are either too complicated, or cannot be represented easily in Java 
  (some benchmarks make extensive use of Macros, for example).
For the time being, we still do not forsee time to implement the LBM benchmark.
