\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

OpenCL, RenderScript, MARE, and TBB have been proposed for devloping compute kernels that
are harware oblivious.
They are designed to accelerate data parallel computation intensive parts of application
code by allowing workloads to be executed on multiple processing cores, GPUs,
DSPs or a combination of these. Here we provide a brief background of OpenCL,
RenderScript, MARE, and TBB.
