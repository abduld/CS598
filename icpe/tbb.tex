\subsection{Thread Building Blocks}


Thread Building Blocks (TBB) is a C++ library developed by Intel that abstract parallel programming
    by reducing them to tasks.
A programmer links tasks if they depend on each other, otherwise the tasks can be run in parallel.
Like MARE, TBB, offers a \fix{parallel\_for} function that executes a function in parallel for the specified range.
While the official distribution of TBB only parallizes on CPUs, researchers\todo{cite} have extended TBB to work
    in hetrogenous programming environments.
In our benchmark, we compile the official TBB distribution on Android.
