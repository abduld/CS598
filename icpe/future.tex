\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Redoing the analysis with relaxed floating points enabled for RenderScript kernels
	and determining what impact that has on both the performance and energy utlization
	would be the first step in understanding the results better.
Fixing bugs that prevented us from running some benchmarks, and completing the
	other benchmark implementations would allow us to have a benchmark
	suite that has been well studied on desktop and would allow us to have more insights
	into which computational patterns have a clear mapping to RenderScript.
Finally, all the devices used are ARM based.
Measuring the performance on Intel or NVIDIA based CPUs or GPUs would give us
	more insight about when to use CPUs or GPUs for computation.
