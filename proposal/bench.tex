\section{Parboil Benchmark Framework}

The Parboil benchmark framework~\cite{Parboil} is a collection
  of 11 compute kernels extracted from parallel applications.
Initially ristricted to CUDA kernels, it now encompases  
  OpenCL kernels (both optimized an unoptimized), 
  C threaded on a shared memory architecture using OpenMP,
  C distributed on a distributed memory architecture using MPI,
  and .
The 11 kernels are sumarized in table~\ref{table:parboil}.
