\subsection{Performance Analysis}

Parboil is unique in the it offers optimized benchmark implementations for different targets.
Benchmarks have been ported for multicore configurations using {\tt C/OpenMP}, 
	GPU implementations using {\tt CUDA} and {\tt OpenCL} exist as well.
There is currently no way to run {\tt CUDA} on Android devices, but OpenCL 2.0~\cite{OpenCL} does
	have support for \textit{Android Installable Client Driver Extension}.
If OpenCL is supported by Android, then we will do performance measurements using it as a base line.
If not, then we will use a native client multithreaded C implementation as our base line.

\subsection{Power Analysis}

Aside from performance, power is an important factor for mobile applications.
Based on a quick survey, there does seem to be power profiling tools for android~\cite{Google:2014:Power}.
We will be looking at how the change in language impacts the power usage of the device.

\subsection{Hardware}

While development will be against the Android emulator, our performance
	metrics will be measrured on real hardware.
Currently we have access to a Nexus 7 Android tablet, but we will contact
	the Android development team to find if there is a way to get
	access to more devices to run our benchmarks.
