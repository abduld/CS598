\section*{Parboil Benchmark Framework}

To measure how effective the RenderScript compiler and runtime
    are, we will be porting the Parboil benchmark framework~\cite{Parboil} to
    RenderScript.
The Parboil benchmark framework is a collection
  of 11 compute kernels extracted from
  real world parallel applications.
Initially restricted to CUDA kernels, Parboil is unique in that it offers
  heavily optimized benchmark implementations for different language targets.
The benchmarks have been ported for multicore configurations using C+OpenMP 
  as well as with OpenCL (both optimized an unoptimized).
The 11 kernels are summarized in table~\ref{table:parboil}.
