\section*{Schedule}

We think we are not too far behind of our initial 
  projection.
We had setup around 1-2 weeks to allow us to recover 
  from some set backs.
In terms of how far behind we are, we are around 2-3
  days behind mainly related to the fact that we 
  still need to do some more work on the infrastructure
  and complete the CUTCP implementation.
To allow us to stay on schedule, we will not be implementing
  the Lattice Bolzmann Machine (LBM) benchmark. 

We have revised the gant chart we included in the proposal
  to reflect our new projected timeline.
