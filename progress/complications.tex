\section*{Complications}

Our main complication came from the fact that we have never developed Android applications
  before.
We approached it as if we were developing Java applications, but quickly realized that 
  there are some constraints placed by the Android environment.

Furthermore, because the Android software and hardware is fragmented, references we found
  on how to solve certain problems either did not pertain to the hardware we were using
  or the Android version we are targeting.
